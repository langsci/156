## Description

This collection of papers on phrasal compounding is part of a bigger
project whose aims are twofold: First, it seeks to broaden the typological
perspective by providing data for as many different languages as possible
to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon itself. Second, based
on these data which clearly show interaction between syntax and mor-
phology it aims to discuss theoretical models which deal with this kind of
interaction in different ways. Models like Generative Grammar, assume
components of grammar and a clear-cut distinction between the lexicon
(often including morphology) and grammar. Other models like construc-
tion grammar do not assume such components and are rather based on a
lexicon including constructs. A comparison of these models on the basis
of this phenomenon on the morphology-syntax interface makes it possible
to assess their descriptive and explanatory power.
